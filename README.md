# Summary of the data set

The iris data set is available from the UCI machine learning repository [1]. It is a frequently used database for demonstrating tools in data anaylsis [2]. The data set consists of 150 observations of iris plants.  Five attributes are recorded. Sepal lenght , sepal width, petal length, petal width,  are measured in centimeters. The class if also given which refers to the type of iris plant. There are three classes with 50 obervations of each, namely Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolour and Iris Virginica. The data set was famously used in a study meausring how these three classes of iris could best be differentiated based on their measurements [3].

# opening the data
For opening the data stored in a csv file I used [4] as  a reference. I decided to use the pandas module to import the data as it made it easy to write the code. With one line of code I could import the data and store it as a data frame. This is a familiar data structure, with the rows showing different observations and the columns their respective attributes. Pandas also offers many other useful features, for example manipulating or visualising data [5]. The

# summary statistics
To create summary statistics for the variables I used the describe() funtion from the pandas module . The describe funtion can be used to generate summary statistics for a variable, such as the mean, standard deviation and percentiles. To output the summary tables to the text file, I first convert the data to text and use the inbuilt write funtion to append the tables. This is a flexible method, which allows titles and text to be added to the tables [7]. I use the option pd.set_option("precision", 2) whichs limit the number of decimal places, making the tables easier to read.

# histograms
To create historgrams of the variables I use the hist() funtion from matplotlib[9]. In addition to plotting the variables I also include optional paramaters for the bin sizes and colors. I also used sample histograms from matplotlibs documentation as a reference[10]. The bins option allowed me to specify how many intervals I wanted to seperate the data into. I use a historgrom using two indices, one for the variable name and title and another for the color. I use a zip() funtion, which is described in more detail in the scatter plots section.

# data as arrays
Storing the columns as arrays is useful in the case that the whole data frame is not needed. It is also necessary for some of the plotting functions in matplotlib, which do not allow for dataframe inputs. The dataFrame.to_numpy() function converts a dataframe object type to a numpy array. dataFrame is the name of the dataframe object, in my case data. In order to get an array for each column or variable I select columns from the data frame using dataFrame("column name") [14]

# scatter plots
I created a scatter plot of the the variables using the scatter() function from matplotlib. I use the default paramaters (x,y) to plot 6 pairs of variables. Matplotlib handles the other parts of creating the graph, such as creating the figure and axis. The other funtions I use are plt.savefig(), and plt.close(). Plt.savefig() takes the filename as a paramater and plt.close() is necessary to create a new figure, so that the individual plots, plt.scatter(), are created seperately. To reduce the lines in the code I use a zip() function 
This allows for parallel iteration [19]. Note there are four variables in total, however the class variable is categorical so I omit it in the scatter plots.

# Additional Analysis
As one of the original uses for this data set was to see which variables could best be used to differentiate classes of the iris plant, I would like to see how the variables, such as sepal lenght and width, vary across the different classes. Some useful approaches include looking at summary statitics, by group, test statistics and graphical representations. 


# group by category
To get summary statistics for each class of iris plant I first need to group the data by class. This is dont with the pandas inbuilt function data.groupby() which takes a column name as its argument[20]. As I labeled the dataframe column with the class names "class" my function is data.groupby(["class"]). To get summary statistics by groups I apply the desc() and sum() functions to these groups. In the describe command I add the option desc(percentiles = []), since the output is easier to read without them [22] and percentiles.
